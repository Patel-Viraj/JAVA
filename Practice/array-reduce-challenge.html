           1.1 Basic Concepts

•	Cryptography The art or science encompassing the principles and methods of transforming an  intelligible
 message into one that is unintelligible, and then retransforming that message back to it original form

•	Plaintext The original intelligible message

•	Cipher text The transformed message

•	Cipher An algorithm for transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible by
  transposition and/or substitution methods

•	Key Some critical information used by the cipher, known only to the sender& receiver

•	Encipher (encode) The process of converting plaintext to cipher text using a cipher and a key

•	Decipher (decode) the process of converting cipher text back into plaintext using a cipher and a key

•	Cryptanalysis The study of principles and methods of transforming an unintelligible message back into an 
       intelligible message without knowledge of the key. Also called code breaking

•	Cryptology Both cryptography and cryptanalysis
1.2 What is  Cryptography?
Cryptography  is  derived from  the Greek words: kryptos, “hidden”, and  graphing “to write” or
“Hidden writing”. People who  study  and  develop cryptography are called  cryptographers. The study of
  how to circumvent the use of cryptography for unintended recipients is called cryptanalysis, or code breaking.
   Cryptography and cryptanalysis are sometimes grouped together under  the  umbrella term cryptology.

Cryptography is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data. Cryptography enables you to 
store sensitive information or transmit it across  insecure networks (like the Internet) so that it cannot
 be read by anyone except the intended recipient. While cryptography is the science of securing data,
  cryptanalysis is the science of analyzing and breaking secure communication. Classical cryptanalysis 
  involves an interesting combination of  analytical reasoning, application of  mathematical tools,
   pattern finding, patience, determination, and luck. Cryptanalysts are also called attackers.
Cryptology embraces both cryptography and cryptanalysis.

However, there has been one central problem limiting widespread use of cryptography. That problem is
 key management. In cryptographic systems, the term key refers to a numerical value used by an algorithm 
 to alter information, making that information secure and visible only to individuals who have the
  corresponding key to recover the information. Consequently, the term

Key  management refers to the secure administration of keys to provide them to users
Where  and  when they are required.

1.3 Cryptography Techniques
Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes
 techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in
  storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated 
  with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as clear text) into cipher text 
  (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this 
  field are known as cryptographers.
Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives:
1.	Confidentiality: the information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended
2.	Integrity: the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended 
receiver without the alteration being detected
3.	Non-repudiation: the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or her intentions
 in the creation or transmission of the information
4.	Authentication: the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination 
of the information
Procedures and protocols that meet some or all of the above criteria are known as cryptosystems. Cryptosystems 
are often thought to refer only to mathematical procedures and computer programs; however, they also include
 the regulation of human behavior, such as choosing hard-to-guess passwords, logging off unused systems, and
  not discussing sensitive procedures with outsiders.
1.4 Cryptographic Algorithms
Cryptosystems use a set of procedures known as cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, to encrypt and decrypt
 messages to secure communications among computer systems, devices such as smart phones, and applications.
  A cipher suite uses one algorithm for encryption, another algorithm for message authentication and another
   for key exchange. This process, embedded in protocols and written in software that runs on operating 
   systems and networked computer systems, involves public and private key generation for data
    encryption/decryption, digital signing and verification for message authentication, and key exchange.
1.5 Types of Cryptography
Single-key or symmetric-key encryption algorithms create a fixed length of bits known as a block cipher 
with a secret key that the creator/sender uses to encipher data (encryption) and the receiver uses to
 decipher it. Types of symmetric-key cryptography include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a 
 specification established in November 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a
  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 197), to protect sensitive information. The standard is
   mandated by the U.S. government and widely used in the private sector.
In June 2003, AES was approved by the U.S. government for classified information. It is a royalty-free 
specification implemented in software and hardware worldwide. AES is the successor to the Data Encryption 
Standard (DES) and DES3. It uses longer key lengths (128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit) to prevent brute force and 
other attacks.
Public-key or asymmetric-key encryption algorithms use a pair of keys, a public key associated with the
 creator/sender for encrypting messages and a private key that only the originator knows (unless it is 
 exposed or they decide to share it) for decrypting that information. The types of public-key cryptography 
 include RSA, used widely on the internet; Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used by Bit
  coin ; Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) adopted as a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital 
  signatures by NIST in FIPS 186-4; and Daffier-Hellman key exchange. To maintain data integrity in
   cryptography, hash functions, which return a deterministic output from an input value, are used to
    map data to a fixed data size. Types of cryptographic hash functions include SHA-1 (Secure Hash
     Algorithm 1), SHA-2 and SHA-3.
1.6 How Does Cryptography Work?

A cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, is a mathematical function used in the encryption and decryption 
process. A cryptographic algorithm works in combination with a key—a word, number, or phrase—to encrypt
 the plaintext. The same plaintext encrypts to different cipher text with different keys. The security
  of encrypted data is entirely dependent on two things: the 
strength of  the cryptographic algorithm and the secrecy of the key.  A cryptographic algorithm, plus
 all possible keys and all the protocols that make it work comprise a cryptosystem.


2. What  is Plaintext?

2.1  Introduction

In  the  study  of  cryptography  the terms  plaintext  and  cipher text  are  used  to  describe  
the  plain  language  message  or  information  and  the  resulting  encrypted  message. Plaintext 
 is  the  term  used  to  refer  to  the  information  in plain  language  that  the  sender  desires
   to  send  to  one  or  more  receiving  computers  or  individuals.

Also  referred  to  as  clear text, plaintext  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  input  to  a cipher
  or  encryption  algorithm. In  cryptography  circles, plaintext  is  commonly  used  as  the  input 
   to  a cipher  or  encryption  algorithm. The  output  of  these  cipher’s  is  normally  referred  
   to  as  cipher text.

 Clear text usually refers to data that is transmitted or stored unencrypted ('in the clear').  Code 
 text is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm involved is actually a               
       code. Some systems use multiple layers of encryption, with the output of one encryption algorithm 
       becoming "plaintext" input for the next.
